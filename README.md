# TwitterGifBot
Work in progress...
- Basic reply bot implemented using `tweepy` and `pythonanywhere`. Cloud hosted 
- Full implementation (incl. storing and vending gifs) requires more work.

Bot is live: the script lives in python anywhere : https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/Kirkampong

## Test the bot :
summon the Phase1(reply) bot by mentioning @YourWiseUncle in your tweet!
