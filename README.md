# TwitterGifBot
Work in progress...
- Basic reply bot implemented using `tweepy` and `pythonanywhere`. Cloud hosted 
- Full implementation (incl. storing and vending gifs) requires more work.

Bot is live: the script lives in python anywhere : https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/Kirkampong

## Test the bot :
* Summon the Phase1(reply) bot by mentioning @YourWiseUncle in your tweet!
* You must include #hashtag **#advice** in your tweet to get a response from the bot. This is because twitter's public APIs make it difficult to distinguish b/n replies and mentions, making it difficult to establish the expected behaviour when the tweet is not in reply to an existing tweet. 
* Media replies tested a bit. Will include this later with a new bot which will be the actual `TwitGifBot`
